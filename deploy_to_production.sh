# npm install --production

# If you're using Python, you might do:

# Step 4: Build assets or run any build commands (if applicable)
# echo "Building assets..."
# npm run build

# Step 5: Deploy the application to the production server

# echo "Deploying using Docker..."
# docker-compose up -d

# Step 6: Restart services (if needed)
# echo "Restarting services..."
# sudo systemctl restart myapp.service

# Step 7: Clear cache (optional, for example, for web apps or PHP apps)
# echo "Clearing cache..."
# php artisan cache:clear  # Example for Laravel

# Step 8: Notify or log the deployment (optional)
